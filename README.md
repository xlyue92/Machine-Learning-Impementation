Modeling practice and codes
## Model pracitice and examples (to be continued)
01) [Monte Carlo Simulation](https://github.com/xlyue92/Machine_Learning_Impementation/blob/master/Monte%20Carlo%20on%20S%26P%20500/S%26P500_Price_MC.ipynb)
    ##### This example is approximation rather than prediction

02) [Prophet Application on Stock Price](https://github.com/xlyue92/Machine_Learning_Impementation/blob/master/Prophet%20on%20S%26P%20500/Explore%20usage%20of%20Prophet%20on%20S%26P%20500%20stock%20price%20prediction.ipynb)

    ##### The example is basic use of Profphet from facebook

03) [LSTM RNN on Stock Price](https://github.com/xlyue92/Machine_Learning_Impementation/blob/master/LSTM%20prediction%20on%20near%20future%20of%20S%26P%20500%20stock%20prices/Introductory%20study%20of%20LSTM%20model%20on%20S%26P%20500%20stock%20price.ipynb)
   
    ##### Using elementary LSTM to make predictions on stock prices
