# Machine-Learning-Impementation
Modeling practice and codes
## Model pracitice and examples (to be continued)
1) [Monte Carlo Simulation](https://github.com/xlyue92/Machine_Learning_Impementation/blob/master/Monte%20Carlo%20on%20S%26P%20500/S%26P500_Price_MC.ipynb)
   
   This example is approximation rather than prediction
2) [Prophet Application on Stock Price](https://github.com/xlyue92/Machine_Learning_Impementation/blob/master/Prophet%20on%20S%26P%20500/Explore%20usage%20of%20Prophet%20on%20S%26P%20500%20stock%20price%20prediction.ipynb)
